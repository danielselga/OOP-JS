// CONCEPTS

// OBJECT-ORIENTED-PROGRAMMING (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. paradigm = style of the code.
// We use objects to model (describe) real-world or abstract features.
// Objects may contains data (properties) and code (methods). By Using objects, we pack data and the corresponding behavior into one block.
// In oop, objects are self-contained pieces/blocks of code.
// Objects are building blocks of aplications, and interact with one another.
// Interactions happens through a public interface (API): methods that the code outside of the object can access and use to comunicate with the project.
// OOP was developed with the global of organizing code, to make it more flexible and easier to maintain (avoid "spaghetti code").

// PRINCIPLES.

// Abstraction:
// Ignoring or hidding details that's dont matter, allowing us to get an overview perspective of the thing  we're implementing...
// intead of messing with details that don't really matter to our implementation.

// Encapsulation:
// Keeping properties and methods private inside the class, so they are not acessible from outside the class. Some methods can be exposed as a Public Interface (API).

// Inheritance:
// Making all properties and methods of a certain class avaliable to a child class, forming a hierarchical relationship between classes. this allows us to...
// reuse cummon logic and to model real-world relationship.

// Polymorphism:
// A child class can overwrite a method it inherithed the parent class.
