// CONCEPTS

// OBJECT-ORIENTED-PROGRAMMING (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. paradigm = style of the code.
// We use objects to model (describe) real-world or abstract features.
// Objects may contains data (properties) and code (methods). By Using objects, we pack data and the corresponding behavior into one block.
// In oop, objects are self-contained pieces/blocks of code.
// Objects are building blocks of aplications, and interact with one another.
// Interactions happens through a public interface (API): methods that the code outside of the object can access and use to comunicate with the project.
// OOP was developed with the global of organizing code, to make it more flexible and easier to maintain (avoid "spaghetti code").
